## A little intro about myself

I hail from Andhra Pradesh. I have completed my +2 at Happy Valley School, Vijaywada and have joined Amrita this year. The clubs at Amrita are really fascinating and that's one of the reasons why I have joined. 
Since childhood I was very much interested in robotics and I wonder how various software around us is built. I would like to join the clubs and explore all the cool stuff.
