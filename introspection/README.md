**a. Why must we choose you?**
- I'm very much intersted in coding, a lot of times I wonder how the cool software stuff around me works like magic. I'm eager to learn how does all these things work. I usually get motivated to work on the things that make curious. And I ensure you that I'm hardworking as well. If something strikes my interest then I would definetly explore that and bulid something useful out of it. 

**b. What is your plan for the next 6 months?**
- I must say that I'm still a beginner in these things, right now I would like learn all the basics and then I'll try to build something out of my learning. Later, I would pick some particular area that interest me and will explore a little more about it. And also I'll try to parallely contribute back to the college by developing something that would be useful.

**c. How would you contribute back to the club?**
- May be I would start with helping my juniors. Build something useful for college, like developing some application required to host various college events or collaborate with professors in various tasks etc.

**d. Do you have any feedback for the selection process?**
- I felt that the tasks are a little bit challenging for newbies like us. There are many students who are very new to such tasks. I had to google a lot of things and finish these tasks. Somehow with my brother's help, I completed a few tasks. I felt it would have been a little better if we were in the college. But, the discord server helped a lot. All these tasks should have been hosted a little later, since most of us are not completly aware of programming and the semester had started late than usual.
